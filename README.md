# Notes

This is a webapp for managing notes. It is a simple webapp that allows you to create, edit, group, and delete notes. You can use the live version(It's totally free to use with no ads and I will keep it that way for as long as I can), or you can host your own webapp locally or on a server while storing your notes safely on a remote deta server (See the [Installation](#Installation) instructions below).

**Feel free to reach out with any bug reports, feature requests or suggestions for better user experience.**

## Motivation:

Taking notes as a developer is a huge part of learning that seems to be neglected by the community in general. Yes I'm not an expert nor a 10x developer but rm I've found taking notes to be very helpful. Normally, I scribble stuff on my copy and it has worked great for me. But I want to take it a step further and have it stored digitally. Then I went on a search for apps with markdown note support but couldn't find one that was good enough for me. So, I decided to create my own. I know this is not perfect in any sense of the word but given the knowledge I have at this point in time, I am pretty satisfied with myself. I will be adding features as I get some free time (some stars would be great too.)
